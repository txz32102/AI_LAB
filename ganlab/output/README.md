### Deploying Your Demo

Run the following command:

```bash
$ ./scripts/deploy-demo
Stored bundle in output/bundle.js
Saved bundled demo at output/index.html
```

It will create two files in this folder: `index.html` and `bundle.js`. 
Then, place these files into a server with `figures/`, `images/`, and `pretrained_models/`.
Please see the branch `gh-pages` for an example.
